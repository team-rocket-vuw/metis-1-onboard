# test-flight-software
A repo containing code for the teams initial flight. This has no control over the rocket, and is used to log sensor data and communicate wirelessly over the 433MHz band.

Code used with the MPU-9825 board was found in this repo: https://github.com/kriswiner/MPU-9250

To run, build circuit and upload code to Teensy of other Arduino compatable microcontroller, with pin numbers adjusted in code to suit your circuit.
